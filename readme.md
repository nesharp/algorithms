# LeetCode Algorithm Solutions

Welcome to the **LeetCode Algorithm Solutions** repository! This repository contains my personal solutions to a variety of algorithmic challenges from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com). The problems cover different topics such as data structures, dynamic programming, sorting, searching, and more.

## Structure

Each solution is placed in its own directory named after the LeetCode problem number and title. The folder contains:

- **Solution file(s)**: Code implementations of the algorithm.
- **Test cases**: Examples or custom test cases to validate the solution.
  How to start tests:
## Example for file structure:
- ├── 0000-example-task-name
  - ├── solution.ts (It's a file with solution of task)
  - ├── goodSolution.ts (It's a file with a solution that was taken from the top ranking LeetCode) 
  - ├── solution.test.ts (It's a file with tests for this task)
## How to start test for tasks:
- Install dependecies:
  - use `yarn install`, `npm install` or others.
- Start the tests:
  - To start the tests run `yarn test` or `npm run test`
